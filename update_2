It's been a while since my last update.  This is partly because I've been somewhat busy with trying 
to make ends meet without a research stipend, but mostly because I'm somewhat shy about posting here,
and not especially sure of what to include.  I've decided that I should approach this journal with the
attitude that it will help me (and hopefully future scientists or metascientists) recover my present 'pathway'
or approach to research, or at least the essential raw elements of it. (Maybe now is a good time for 
me to read SÃ¶nke Ahren's book on the dao of note-taking, which I am browsing on Amazon as I write this.
I also intend to consult a book that I've stumbled into on the internet, ostensibly by Michel Foucault, 
titled somewhat ominously, "The Archeology of Knowledge".)

To start, I thought I would keep a basic (inevitably only partial) record of what ideas might influence 
my work, whether these come from published literature or casual conversations, catalogued by subject and maybe 
date and author as well.  At the very least, this will help me write bibliographies and ascribe influence
accurately and fairly.  

I might also include a list of sources that I hope to learn from at some point, or conversations that I
would like to hold (e.g. "Would it be worth studying memory effects in open quantum systems in greater detail?",
"Can a connection to be made between machine learning, RG style coarse-graining, and RNA/protein physics?")

Beyond this it might also be good to keep notes or a summary of each source if possible, ideally in a sharable 
format, as well as my responses, and a record of how I spend my time (e.g. 2 hours commuting, 8 at work doing x,
1 hour reading y, 3 hours programming z, 7 hours procrastinating, etc.), on top of whatever spectacular thoughts
enter my head that I think are worth sharing, and other less than spectacular thoughts that I may share reluctantly
out of a sense of obligation. [to be continued]
