I'm returning to this after a somewhat longer-than-expected hiatus.
Today I'm interested in exploring the dynamics of pendula that are attached to rotors,
specifically the small-angle oscillations about steady state orbits. The point of this
is mainly to dust off my classical dynamics intuition, but also to allow the possibility
that there is more to learn from this class of examples.  Eventually, I would like to 
consider how the centrifugal force gradient influences the dynamics of extended rigid bodies,
but I thought I would start with small point masses for simplicity. (It might also be interesting
to look at how the dynamics changes when the rotor/centrifuge is tilted at an angle w.r.t. 
an external gravitational field.)
